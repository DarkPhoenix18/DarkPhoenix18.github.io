It is recognized as one of the creme-de-la-creme names in education in India which provides education from play group to grade 12. We are guided by the Philosophy of Education promulgated by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. We believe in partnership with our parents to impart value based education to our children that would chisel them into good human beings, for education is not about getting 90% alone; it is about believing in and living the spirit of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam".<br>
                The school believes that all education is within so children are exposed to a wide range of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities to find their interests and perfection within. To develop the 21st century skills of analysis, innovation, creativity, problem solving, collaboration and communication, the school encourages student led initiatives.<br>

                About Navsrijan<br>
                In November 2010 Seth M.R. Jaipuria took the initiative to start a school for underprivileged children. We called it Navsrijan, a New Beginning, and enrolled 49 children in the first year. Today we have 340 children. We take care of all their needs and impart free education (same as Jaipuria School), inclusive of uniform, books, IT education, fine arts and performing arts and sports. Besides regular classes, we teach them Sanskrit, Yoga, Music and hone their skills in sports. It’s a matter of pride for us that 36 of the Navsrijan children joined mainstream school in the last 10 years and are now Jaipuria students, securing a whopping average of 80% and above, beating the mainstream students. They continue to study in Jaipuria School free of cost. Achievements:<br>
